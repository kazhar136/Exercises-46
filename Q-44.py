"""Your task in this exercise is as follows:
Generate a string with N opening brackets ("[") and N closing brackets ("]"), in some arbitrary order.
Determine whether the generated string is balanced; that is, whether it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing brackets (in that
order), none of which mis-nest.
Examples:
   []        OK   ][        NOT OK
   [][]      OK   ][][      NOT OK
   [[][]]    OK   []][[]    NOT OK"""+
